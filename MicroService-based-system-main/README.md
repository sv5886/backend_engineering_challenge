# MicroService-based-system
In this assignment, I will build a microservices-based system that manages a simple e-commerce application. The system should handle user authentication, product management, and order processing. Emphasis will be placed on implementing concurrency control and ensuring the system can handle clustering for high availability.

# Simple Authentication System

This project provides a simple authentication system where users can register themselves using the register API. After successful registration, users receive an API key in the response and via email. This API key allows users to access other methods or APIs that are specific to their API key. Users can use these APIs to manage orders and products.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:
4. Install dependencies:

## Usage

1. Register a new user:
- Use the register API to create a new user account.
- Provide username, email, and password.
- Upon successful registration, an API key will be provided in the response and sent to the user's email.

2. Access other methods with API key:
- Use the received API key to access other methods or APIs specific to the user.
- These methods may include managing orders and products.
